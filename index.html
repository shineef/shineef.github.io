        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
            My academic and research interests are primarily focused on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, 
            and Cloud Computing, among other emerging technologies in the field of computer science.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/rl">Reinforcement Learning</a></h3>
                <p>I have developed and implemented a range of algorithms designed for autonomous mastery in gaming applications. 
                    These include the Markov Decision Process, Monte Carlo methods, Temporal Difference learning, 
                    and Duelling Double Deep Q-Networks, among others. This work focused on leveraging these sophisticated techniques 
                    to enhance decision-making and strategy formulation in complex game environments. A significant aspect of 
                    my work involved enhancing the replay memory mechanism and other components of the DQN method, thereby 
                    improving the overall efficacy and performance of these machine learning models in complex simulations.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/Recommender-System">Information Retrieval</a></h3>
            <p>My experience encompasses the design and implementation of recommender systems, where I utilized item-based collaborative 
                filtering techniques. It was designed using various similarity metrics to optimize recommendations. In enhancing the system's 
                capabilities, I also incorporated sophisticated deep learning methods. This included the integration of Neural Collaborative 
                Filtering and Transformer models, which were instrumental in elevating the system's performance and overall functionality. 
                These deep learning techniques contributed to a more dynamic and user-responsive recommendation process.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/Image-Identification">Computer Vision</a></h3>
            <p>With a background in image processing and pattern recognition, I have mastered advanced techniques such as 
                Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers. My competence in image processing includes the ability 
                to discern symbols within images and adeptly utilize classification algorithms like KNN and Rocchio. 
                Additionally, my portfolio includes diverse projects, such as handwriting recognition, where I have applied 
                these skills to achieve precise and effective outcomes.</p>
