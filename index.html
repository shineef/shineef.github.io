        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where my academic 
            journey and research endeavors are deeply entrenched in the realms of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and 
            Cloud Computing. My interest not only spans these pivotal areas but has recently honed in on the exploration and advancement
             of Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/rl">Reinforcement Learning</a></h3>
                <p>I have developed and implemented a range of algorithms designed for autonomous mastery in gaming applications. 
                    These include the Markov Decision Process, Monte Carlo methods, Temporal Difference learning, 
                    and Duelling Double Deep Q-Networks, among others. This work focused on leveraging these sophisticated techniques 
                    to enhance decision-making and strategy formulation in complex game environments. A significant aspect of 
                    my work involved enhancing the replay memory mechanism and other components of the DQN method, thereby 
                    improving the overall efficacy and performance of these machine learning models in complex simulations.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/NLP">Natural Language Process</a></h3>
                <p>In this project, I explored the characteristics of real and fake news using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
                     The primary goal was to identify patterns and features that distinguish authentic news content from fabricated stories. Utilized 
                     techniques such as TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and word embeddings to prepare the data for modeling.</p>
                     <h4>Data Exploration and Preprocessing</h4>
                     <p>Investigated the most commonly used words in real and fake news articles to understand initial patterns.</p>
                     <h4>Feature Engineering</h4>
                     <p>Utilized techniques such as TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and word embeddings to prepare the data for modeling.</p>
                     <h4>Model Building</h4>
                     <p>Experimented with multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify news articles.</p>
                     <h4>Results</h4>
                     <p>The LSTM model outperformed others, achieving remarkable precision, recall, and accuracy metrics in classifying news articles, with an accuracy exceeding 99.6%.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/Recommender-System">Information Retrieval</a></h3>
                <p>In my journey of developing recommender systems, I considered the realm of item-based collaborative filtering and matrix 
                    factorization. It was designed using various similarity metrics to optimize recommendations. This technique revolves around 
                    the concept of understanding and leveraging the relationships between different items based on user interactions and preferences.</p>
                <p>Taking the system a notch higher, I ventured into the integration of advanced deep learning methods. This included 
                    the implementation of Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Transformer models. The incorporation of NCF allowed me 
                    to blend the classic matrix factorization approach with deep neural networks. In addition to utilizing Transformer models 
                    in my recommender system, where their capacity to handle complex dependencies in natural language processing, I am 
                    exploring further applications.</p>

            <p>With a background in image processing and pattern recognition, I have mastered advanced techniques such as 
                Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers. My competence in image processing includes the ability 
                to discern symbols within images and adeptly utilize classification algorithms like KNN and Rocchio. 
                Additionally, my portfolio includes diverse projects, such as handwriting recognition, where I have applied 
                these skills to achieve precise and effective outcomes.</p>
