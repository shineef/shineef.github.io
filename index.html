            <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/rl">Reinforcement Learning</a></h3>
            <p>I have developed and implemented a range of algorithms designed for autonomous mastery in gaming applications. 
                These include the Markov Decision Process, Monte Carlo methods, Temporal Difference learning, 
                and Deep Q-Networks (D3QN), among others. This work focused on leveraging these sophisticated techniques 
                to enhance decision-making and strategy formulation in complex game environments.</p>
