        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
            My academic and research interests are primarily focused on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, 
            and Cloud Computing, among other emerging technologies in the field of computer science.</p>

                <p>I have developed and implemented a range of algorithms designed for autonomous mastery in gaming applications. 
                    These include the Markov Decision Process, Monte Carlo methods, Temporal Difference learning, 
                    and Deep Q-Networks (D3QN), among others. This work focused on leveraging these sophisticated techniques 
                    to enhance decision-making and strategy formulation in complex game environments. A significant aspect of 
                    my work involved enhancing the replay memory mechanism and other components of the DQN method, thereby 
                    improving the overall efficacy and performance of these machine learning models in complex simulations.</p>

            <p>In addition to my work on autonomous gaming algorithms, I have also developed recommender systems 
                utilizing both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering techniques. These systems were 
                designed using various similarity metrics to optimize recommendations. Furthermore, I have 
                integrated deep learning methods to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of these systems, 
                showcasing a blend of traditional filtering approaches with advanced neural network models.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/shineef/Image-Identification">Computer Vision</a></h3>
            <p>With a background in image processing and pattern recognition, I have mastered advanced techniques such as 
                Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers. My competence in image processing includes the ability 
                to discern symbols within images and adeptly utilize classification algorithms like KNN and Rocchio. 
                Additionally, my portfolio includes diverse projects, such as handwriting recognition, where I have applied 
                these skills to achieve precise and effective outcomes.</p>
